Hello, today I am sharing my new resource made in full NativeUI reloaded.



The authors are:

[https://github.com/iTexZoz/NativeUILua_Reloaded]

[https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended]

[https://github.com/kanersps/essentialmode]

You need to es_extended is essentialmode and esx_mechanicjob or esx_mecanojob.

To install it:

start after es_extended and essentialmode. NativeUI is already included in.

If you want to change prices you have to go in the config.lua.
